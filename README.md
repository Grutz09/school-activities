Title:
**Adventurer's Guild: Battle of Power**

Theme:
You are the leader of a renowned adventurer's guild. Your mission is to manage your team of warriors based on their power levels using heap operations. Recruit powerful adventurers, send the strongest into battle, and reorganize your team with fresh recruits from the guild. Keep your party strong and ready for any challenge!

Tasks:
Recruit a New Adventurer

Insert a new adventurer with a given power level into the Max-Heap and display the updated party.
Learning Goal: Practice maintaining a Max-Heap structure during insertions.
Send the Strongest Adventurer to Battle

Remove the root of the Max-Heap (the strongest adventurer) and reorganize the heap to maintain its properties.
Learning Goal: Understand how deletion works in heaps and how to restore the heap property.
Recruit Random Adventurers and Organize Them

Generate a random list of adventurers with varying power levels, apply the heapify operation to organize them into a Max-Heap, and replace your current party.
Learning Goal: Experience how random data can be converted into a structured Max-Heap using the heapify algorithm.
View Your Current Party (Optional, Auxiliary Task)

Display the current state of the heap to visualize the structure and hierarchy of your adventurers.
Learning Goal: Reinforce the concept of a Max-Heap by examining its properties in real-time.
