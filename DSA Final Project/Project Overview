Project Overview
This project implements fundamental data structures—Binary Tree, Binary Search Tree (BST), and Heap (Max-Heap and Min-Heap)—and provides an interactive way to explore their functionalities. 
These data structures are essential, commonly used for efficient data storage, retrieval, and manipulation. 
The project includes a menu-based interface for users to perform operations on these structures, making it a practical learning tool.

Key Features:
Binary Tree Operations:
Traverse a binary tree using pre-order, in-order, and post-order methods.

Binary Search Tree (BST) Operations:
Insert, delete, and search for nodes.
Traverse the BST.

Heap Operations:
Implement max-heap and min-heap structures.
Insert elements and remove the root element.
